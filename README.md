# Detecting Dark Matter
My solutions to Detecting Dark Matter workshop by Singularity, IISER-Kolkata

## Solution files and folders
1. `rot_curve.png` - Final galactic rotational curve
2. `MultipeakFit/TempVel/` - Contains CSV files of velocity data for all longitudes ranging from 15 to 85 degrees, used for multipeak fitting to find v_obs
3. `Results/` - Contains intermediate plots produced while generating velocity data for multipeak fitting
4. `AnalysisH1.ipynb` - Used for generating data for multipeak fitting
5. `Rot_curveH1.ipynb` - Used for generating galactic rotation curve plot
