# Detecting Dark Matter
My solutions to Detecting Dark Matter workshop by Singularity, IISER-Kolkata

## Solution files and folders
1. `AnalysisH1.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook used for generating data for multipeak fitting
2. `Rot_curveH1.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook used for generating galactic rotation curve plot
3. `Results\` - Contains intermediate plots produced while generating velocity data for multipeak fitting
4. `MultipeakFit\` - Contains image files of multipeak fitted plots
5. `MultipeakFit\TempVel\` - Contains CSV files of velocity data for all longitudes ranging from 15 to 85 degrees, used for multipeak fitting to find v_obs
6. `MultipeakFit\MultipeakFit.sciprj` - SciDAVis project file used for multipeak fitting
7. `rot_curve.png` - Final galactic rotational curve image file

## Sample files (not part of my solutions)
1. `AnalysisH1_REF.ipynb`
2. All files in `Results\sample\`
3. `MultipeakFit\sample25.png`
